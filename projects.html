                <h3>Cloudy with a Chance of Lora (Weather Station)</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project, we built a small weather station to be installed on the roof of Otago Polytechnic, aimed at providing valuable data for Dunedinites. 
                    This experience allowed me to utilize my skills in embedded systems and web development.

                <ul class="listicles">
                    <li><strong>Next.js:</strong> We chose to use Next.js for our full-stack application, enabling us to create an API without Express. This was a new opportunity for me to deepen my understanding of full-stack development.</li>
                    <li><strong>LoRa:</strong> We utilized LoRa technology to transmit our data to The Things Network. This was my first experience sending data from an Arduino for IoT applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Things Network (TTN):</strong> Our LoRa data was sent to TTN, allowing us to pull it back down to our API. Until this project, I hadnâ€™t worked with webhooks before, which was a valuable learning opportunity.</li>
                    <li><strong>3D Modeling:</strong> Alongside this project we have provided support to another project that displays c02 levels in the classroom i have been involved in this proccess by building new sensors and designing and printing cases for them.</li>

                <h3>Rainy Arcade</h3>
                <p>In this project we built a modern arcade prototype for use in game jams and for the Games Students</p>

                <ul class="listicles">
                    <li><strong>Backend:</strong> The big learning development for me working on this backend for me was learning to use the child processs node library for executing commands used mainly for loading the games aswell as using programtic approaches to maintain only one game being loaded and that they load correctly</li>
